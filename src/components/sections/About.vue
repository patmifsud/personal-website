      <p>
        Iâ€™m a front end developer and UX designer based in Sydney,
        Australia. I have a love for building things from scratch quickly,
        thinking through experiences end-to-end and all things product.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mainly work with Javascript, React, Vue, CSS, and Firebase.
